## What is this?

Freenalytics is an open source usage analytics platform for any type of application. It serves as a tool to empower
small development teams that need a customizable analytics compilation service in their applications that can be self-hosted
easily.

## Why?

This project aims to be a simple yet powerful analytics dashboard for any type of application that can benefit from usage analytics,
from simple websites, to server applications, to maybe even bots for [Discord](https://discord.com).

It is still in an early stage and currently works as a "simple log aggregator" with bare bones visualization tools.

Finally, it was built as a final college project as a requirement to get my Computer Science Engineer degree.
