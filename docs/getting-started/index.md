# Getting Started

This section contains some information to help you get up and running with Freenalytics.

## Installation

To check how to install Freenalytics, check out [Hosting with Docker](./docker-hosting.md) which is the recommended way to host this service.

If you wish to install this manually without [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), check out [Hosting with Node.js](./node-hosting.md).
Hosting this manually will require you to build the service on your machine. It also assumes you have existing [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
and [Redis](https://redis.io/) instances to attach to Freenalytics.

## Using Freenalytics

Once you're all set up, check out:

* [Creating your First Application](./creating-your-first-application.md)
* [Uploading Data](./uploading-data.md)

To learn how to use this service and integrate it to your applications.

In case you need to export all your data as a CSV file, check out [Export Data](./exporting-data.md).
